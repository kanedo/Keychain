# Keychain
Swift Class for Easy Keychain Access

Initial version developed by [Clayton McIlrath](https://gist.github.com/thinkclay/6552cffb7780176de62e).

This fork fixed some errors related to `Unmanaged` as described on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24053618/swift-convert-nsmutabledata-to-nsstring)
so it works with Swift 2.2 and Xcode 7.3.1
